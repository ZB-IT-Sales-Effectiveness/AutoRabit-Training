    <description>This will tell you the expected revenue from an opportunity based on the close date and the days between the end of the close date&apos;s year. For example if close date is 03/01/2020 and the amount is 120,000, the formula calculates days between 03/01/2020 to the end of the year (12/31/2020) . The value is 305 days . The formula will then take the percent of (3005/365) * amount and you get $100,274. That is an estimate of how much potential revenue you should expect to see from this opportunity based on the year of the close date.</description>
